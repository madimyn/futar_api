# Public Transport Accessibility Analysis in Budapest  

## Welcome! 🚋✨
Hi there! I'm excited to share my **Public Transport Accessibility Analysis** project with you. This project dives into the wheelchair accessibility of Budapest's public transport system (**BKK**) using real-time data from the **BKK API**. It showcases my skills in **data collection, analysis, and visualization**, all while addressing an important real-world issue—ensuring **equal mobility for everyone**!  

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
- **Analyze wheelchair accessibility** across BKK's tram, bus, and metro network
- **Quantify** what percentage of Budapest's public transport is accessible
- **Map out** which stations can be reached from accessible starting points
- **Visualize** accessibility data to make insights clear and impactful

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
### **Data Collection & Processing**
✅ Integrated with the **BKK API** for real-time public transport data  
✅ Cleaned & structured data using **Pandas**  
✅ Stored insights in **CSV files** for further analysis  

### **Data Analysis**
📊 Performed statistical analysis on **accessibility by district and transport type**  
📊 Compared **accessible vs. non-accessible stops**  
📊 Broke down accessibility **district-wise** for deeper insights  

### **Data Visualization**
🗺️ Created **interactive maps** with **Folium** to highlight accessibility gaps  
📈 Built **bar charts & comparative graphs** using **Matplotlib**  
🎨 Designed **custom visualization classes** to explore different perspectives  

### **Technical Implementation**
🖥️ Used **Python** and powerful libraries:  
- **Requests** → API integration  
- **Pandas** → Data wrangling  
- **Folium** → Mapping  
- **Matplotlib** → Statistical visualizations  
🛠️ Followed an **object-oriented, modular coding approach** for maintainability

## 🔍 Key Findings
🚉 **Total Stops Analyzed:** 544  
♿ **Wheelchair Accessible Stops:** 377 (69% of total)  
🏙️ **Most Accessible District:** District V (93 stops)  
🚌 **Most Common Transport Type:** All 544 stops serve buses

## 💡 Why Does This Matter? (Business Impact)
This project is more than just numbers—it's about **making transportation more inclusive**. My analysis could help:
- **BKK & City Planners** → Identify and bridge accessibility gaps 🚧
- **Policymakers** → Prioritize infrastructure improvements 🏗️
- **Citizens with mobility challenges** → Plan better routes with confidence ✅
